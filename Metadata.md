## What is Metadata?

The MDA tracks a variety of metadata on high-traffic tables. Metadata is information _about_ the data that we are sourcing and/or creating, include:
  * Where the data came from (source)
  * When the data was aquired
  * Versioning associated with different versions of the data
  * What the field names mean
  * Any information about how the data was created/generated/derived
  * and more...
