The Center on Rural Innovation ([CORI](https://ruralinnovation.us/)) is
a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization partnering with rural leaders across
the country to build tech economies that support scalable
entrepreneurship and lead to more tech jobs in rural America.

These repositories are maintained by the *Mapping and Data Analytics*
(MDA) team at CORI/RISI.

Our team provides data, analytics and visualizations to support rural
participation in the digital economy through scalable entrepreneurship
and tech job growth in rural America.

We strive towards serving as the primary center of excellence advancing
sustainable, economic opportunity and equity in rural America. We do
this by providing expert spatial and statistical analysis, modernized
visualization and tool development, credible technical subject matter
expertise, and transparent documentation.
