## S3 storage: 

- [ ] csv (R read into memory)  

- [ ] pmtiles ???

- [ ] does it need to download to your computer vs accessing directly to the cloud?

- [ ] parquet 

- handling permissions / credentials in R 
    * [ ] listing 
    * [ ] reading
    * [ ] writing 

- [ ] targets?

- [ ] duckDB <-> s3

- [ ] back end: arrow vs duckdb vs polars? 

### R option to interact with S3 

- [Pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/index.html): can write parquet / arrow etc, dev. by the Posit team, I have not a clear view of their dependencies ..

- [arrow's FileSystem classes](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/main/r/man/FileSystem.Rd) or better `help("FileSystem", package = "arrow")`

- [paws](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/) package for the full suite of AWS services, wrapper of SDK. For s3 see [here](https://www.paws-r-sdk.com/examples/s3/).
