Our tradable broadband knowledge set is focused on how to pull people together to plan/build broadband infrastructure in strategic ways.

To do this we need:

  - **Collaboration** and **Share-ability** (!)
      - **Web-based map** views that can be shared and accessed by **URL**
        - Currently, this capability is primarily supported by Carto
        - Potential enablement with ArcGIS Online:
          - “_it seemed like a better version of Carto_” - Myles
  - Understanding of telecommunications **infrastructure** and landscape:
      - **Where** is/is not
         - Operating footprint
         - Grant funded areas (past awards?)
      - **What** (tech + service level)
        - ISP presence
        - Advertised speeds
          - Categorized by grant criteria (e.g. BEAD)
      - **Who** (ownership)
        - DBA mapped back to single entity (source-of-truth)
        - Funding history (previous grant recipient?)
      - **Density** of (potential) subscribers
      - **Social/Demographic** analysis of (potential) subscribers
          - Calculate route miles needed for potential deployments in more sophisticated manner
  - Understanding **actual performance** (average speeds) of broadband networks
  - Understanding **physical topology** (layout) of existing network
      - Ability to **model** and **compare** models of potential (future) **physical topology** of networks
          - Determine/calculate feasibility by:
            - Costs
            - Route Miles
            - Technology
  - Dynamically assess multiple geographic contexts for potential infrastructure planning
      - compare these contexts
      - non-standard geographies driven by real world requirements
      - Lowest level of geographic context may be neighborhood
      - May approximate mapping of block-level data to non-standard geography; when possible (_this is hard_)
      - Some geography selection is by **name**
        - Ability to map names to geospatial representations
      - Would block-selector tool be helpful?
        - +support for automatically suggesting block set mappings for non-standard geographic features as well, as mapping to geographically-relevant names (within limited/scoped contexts)
