Our tradable broadband knowledge set is focused on how to pull people together to plan/build broadband infrastructure in strategic ways.

To do this we need:
  - **Collaboration** and **Share-ability** (!)
      - **Web-based map** views that can be shared and accessed by **URL**
        - Currently, this capability is primarily supported by Carto
        - Potential enablement with ArcGIS Online:
          - “_it seemed like a better version of Carto_” - Myles
  - Understanding of telecommunications **infrastructure** and landscape:
      - **Where** is/is not
         - Operating footprint
         - Grant funded areas (past awards?)
      - **What** (tech + service level)
        - ISP presence
        - Advertised speeds
          - Categorized by grant criteria
        - [Insert BEAD dynamic tool requirments here...]
      - **Who** (ownership)
        - DBA mapped back to single entity (source-of-truth)
        - Funding history (previous grant recipient?)
      - **Density** of (potential) subscribers
  - Understanding real life performance of BB networks
  - Dynamically assess multiple geographic contexts for potential infrastructure planning;
      - compare these contexts
      - non-standard geographies driven by real world requirements
  - Lowest level of geographic context may be neighborhood
  - May approximate mapping of block-level data to non-standard geography; when possible (_this is hard_)
  - Some geography selection is by **name**
      - Ability to map names to geospatial representations
  - Would block-selector tool be helpful?
      - With support for automatically suggesting block set mappings for non-standard geographic features as well, as mapping to geographically-relevant names (within limited/scoped contexts)

## Fixed Broadband Availability Data
[FCC National Broadband Map](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download/nationwide-data)

To perform place-based analysis on broadband access, service availability, and relative affordability, including broadband serviceable location data, we utilize the [BDC Public Data Downloads](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download/nationwide-data) repository and [BDC Public Data API](https://us-fcc.box.com/v/bdc-public-data-api-spec) served by the FCC National Broadband Map. To date, we are not seeking, nor have we been granted access to the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric dataset (sometimes referred to as the _FCC Broadband Fabric_, _FCC Fabric_, or _Location Fabric_) produced by CQA ([CostQuest Associates](https://www.costquest.com/)).
