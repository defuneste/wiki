## S3 storage: 

- [ ] csv (R read into memory)  

- [ ] pmtiles ???

- [ ] does it need to download to your computer vs accessing directly to the cloud?

- [ ] parquet 

- handling permissions / credentials in R 
    * [ ] listing 
    * [ ] reading
    * [ ] writing 

- [ ] targets?

- [ ] duckd <-> s3

- [ ] back end: arrow vs duckdb vs polars? 

### R option to interact with S3 

- [Pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/index.html): can write parquet / arrow etc, dev by Posit team, I have not a clear view of their dependencies ..


## arrow / duckdb

- [ ] maturity on OS 

- [ ] maturity in R 

- [ ] status on spatial operations

- [ ] PG -> parquet 

- [ ] appending parquet? 

- on Arrow posts from Danielle: https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-26_strange-year/#writing-about-apache-arrow (usually awesome)
