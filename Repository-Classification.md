## Repositories can have one of 5 statuses

---------------------

![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-green.svg)

This should be the standard tag for repositories that are not under active development. Stable code should have no anticipated breaking changes and have received some QA. To mark  a repository as stable:

---------------------

- Paste `![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-green.svg)` into the `readme` and commit changes
- Add 'stable' as a topic for the repository

---------------------

![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)

Maturing repositories are under active development. This tag should not be used long-term. It indicates that breaking changes are expected in the code. To be labeled 'Maturing', the existing code should have received some level of QA but is subject to change. To mark  a repository as maturing:

- Paste `![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)` into the `readme` and commit changes
- Add 'maturing' as a topic for the repository

---------------------

![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)

This tag should be used sparingly -- ideally we should have few experimental repos. Code in an experimental repo may not have received any QA. Nothing generated from an experimental repo should be used in a deliverable or as the foundation for other code without serious external review. To mark  a repository as experimental:

- Paste `![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)` into the `readme` and commit changes
- Add 'experimental' as a topic for the repository

---------------------

![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-deprecated-red.svg)

We may wish to preserve legacy code in some repositories. These should be marked as deprecated and link to the current state of the art.  To mark  a repository as deprecated:

- Paste `![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-deprecated-red.svg)` into the `readme` and commit changes
- Add 'deprecated' as a topic for the repository
