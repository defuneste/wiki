  - is a location that can have access to multiple ISPs, each offering different services (technologies, upload, download speed).
  - can be split into residential and business locations but this distinction does not seem very effective in the [National Broadband Map](#the-national-broadband-map) dataset.
  - is not geographically represented with exact latitude and longitude, but only by [census block](#a-block) geoid and H3 index in the NBM dataset (MDA references this data as the National Broadband Map; officially the dataset is released as [BDC (Broadband Data Collection) Public Data](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download/nationwide-data)).

### The [National Broadband Map](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/) ...
  - is an ongoing initiative within the Federal Communications Commission
  - provides information about the internet services available to individual locations across the country, along with new maps of mobile coverage, as reported by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the FCC’s ongoing Broadband Data Collection.
