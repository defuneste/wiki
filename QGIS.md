This will include some materials for the use of QGIS

## Connecting QGIS to CORI RDS DB

Resource: https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/user_manual/auth_system/auth_overview.html 

To interact with qgis in R: https://r-spatial.github.io/qgisprocess/ 

In QGIS: 

 1. `QGIS` -> `Preferences` -> `Authentication`

 2. In Authentication use the green âž• to add a new way of doing it.

If it is the first time it will ask you to set up a master password (I think it is just for mac).

 3. Use the drop down menu to select `Basic authentication`

 4. Pick a name: I am using `cori` 

 5. Provide the correct Username and Password

In QGIS `Browser`: 

 1. Right click on `PostgreSQL` 

 2. `New connections` 

 3. Pick a name (again I am using CORI)

 4. Host: our aws RDS 

 5. Port: we are using the default one (5432)

 6. Database name: the name of the DB, we will not use SSL (but we probably could)

 7. In Athentication select the previous configurations we have done

 8.  You can "Test Connection" 

If it is good you can press `ok` if not review the Host name other parameters.

You should be able to browse `schema` and `table` from the database.
