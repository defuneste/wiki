#### The Zen of Functional Programming (The Zen of Python +)

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Whatever that way may be, document it here for the sake of your coworkers and yourself six months from now.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Copy and paste is the root of 42% of all evil.
- If you would copy and paste code a third time, instead write a function.
- If you would copy and paste a function for the third time in a script, instead use a functional.
- Although a loop is better than nothing.
- If you would copy a function into a new script even once, document it and add it to the coriverse.
